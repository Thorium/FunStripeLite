## Installation

Get the latest version from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FunStripeLite/)

## Usage

Open the StripeModel and StripeRequest modules.

Here's an example of how to create a new payment method:

```F#
let settings = RestApi.StripeApiSettings.New(apiKey = "<your Stripe API key>")

let getNewPaymentMethod () =
    asyncResult {
        return! 
            PaymentMethods.CreateOptions.New(
                card = Choice2Of2 (PaymentMethods.Create'CardTokenParams.New("tok_visa")),
                type' = PaymentMethods.Create'Type.Card
            )
            |> PaymentMethods.Create settings
    }
```

The result value is an `AsyncResult<PaymentMethod,ErrorResponse>`, giving you the requested object in case of success or a detailed error response if not.

The general format of API requests is `<module>`.`<method>` `settings` `options`.

To instantiate the `settings` you need to pass in your Stripe API key. Having local rather than global settings allows you to use different keys for different Stripe accounts if you need to.

The `options` can be provided using record notation or if there are many uninitialised properties you can use the static `New` method to instantiate the record more effiently.
